3. General explanations.—(1) Throughout this Sanhita every definition of an offence, every penal
provision, and every Illustration of every such definition or penal provision, shall be understood subject
to the exceptions contained in the Chapter entitled “General Exceptions”, though those exceptions are not
repeated in such definition, penal provision, or Illustration.
Illustrations.
(a) The sections in this Sanhita, which contain definitions of offences, do not express that a child
under seven years of age cannot commit such offences; but the definitions are to be understood subject to
the general exception which provides that nothing shall be an offence which is done by a child under
seven years of age.
(b) A, a police officer, without warrant, apprehends Z, who has committed murder. Here A is not
guilty of the offence of wrongful confinement; for he was bound by law to apprehend Z, and therefore the
case falls within the general exception which provides that “nothing is an offence which is done by a
person who is bound by law to do it”.
(2) Every expression which is explained in any Part of this Sanhita, is used in every Part of this
Sanhita in conformity with the explanation.
(3) When property is in the possession of a person’s spouse, clerk or servant, on account of that
person, it is in that person’s possession within the meaning of this Sanhita.
19
Explanation.—A person employed temporarily or on a particular occasion in the capacity of a clerk
or servant, is a clerk or servant within the meaning of this sub-section.
(4) In every Part of this Sanhita, except where a contrary intention appears from the context, words
which refer to acts done extend also to illegal omissions.
(5) When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all,
each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone.
(6) Whenever an act, which is criminal only by reason of its being done with a criminal knowledge or
intention, is done by several persons, each of such persons who joins in the act with such knowledge or
intention is liable for the act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone with that knowledge
or intention.
(7) Wherever the causing of a certain effect, or an attempt to cause that effect, by an act or by an
omission, is an offence, it is to be understood that the causing of that effect partly by an act and partly by
an omission is the same offence.
Illustration.
A intentionally causes Z’s death, partly by illegally omitting to give Z food, and partly by beating Z.
A has committed murder.
(8) When an offence is committed by means of several acts, whoever intentionally cooperates in the
commission of that offence by doing any one of those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person,
commits that offence.
Illustrations.
(a) A and B agree to murder Z by severally and at different times giving him small doses of poison.
A and B administer the poison according to the agreement with intent to murder Z. Z dies from the
effects the several doses of poison so administered to him. Here A and B intentionally cooperate in the
commission of murder and as each of them does an act by which the death is caused, they are both guilty
of the offence though their acts are separate.
(b) A and B are joint jailors, and as such have the charge of Z, a prisoner, alternatively for six hours
at a time. A and B, intending to cause Z’s death, knowingly cooperate in causing that effect by illegally
omitting, each during the time of his attendance, to furnish Z with food supplied to them for that purpose.
Z dies of hunger. Both A and B are guilty of the murder of Z.
(c) A, a jailor, has the charge of Z, a prisoner. A, intending to cause Z’s death, illegally omits to
supply Z with food; in consequence of which Z is much reduced in strength, but the starvation is not
sufficient to cause his death. A is dismissed from his office, and B succeeds him. B, without collusion or
cooperation with A, illegally omits to supply Z with food, knowing that he is likely thereby to cause Z’s
death. Z dies of hunger. B is guilty of murder, but, as A did not cooperate with B. A is guilty only of an
attempt to commit murder.
(9) Where several persons are engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act, they may be
guilty of different offences by means of that act.
Illustration.
A attacks Z under such circumstances of grave provocation that his killing of Z would be only
culpable homicide not amounting to murder. B, having ill-will towards Z and intending to kill him, and
not having been subject to the provocation, assists A in killing Z. Here, though A and B are both engaged
in causing Z’s death, B is guilty of murder, and A is guilty only of culpable homicide.
CHAPTER II
OF PUNISHMENTS
4. Punishments. —The punishments to which offenders are liable under the provisions of this
Sanhita are—
20
(a) Death;
(b) Imprisonment for life;
(c) Imprisonment, which is of two descriptions, namely:—
(1) Rigorous, that is, with hard labour;
(2) Simple;
(d) Forfeiture of property;
(e) Fine;
(f) Community Service.
5. Commutation of sentence.—The appropriate Government may, without the consent of the
offender, commute any punishment under this Sanhita to any other punishment in accordance
with section 474 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023.
Explanation.—For the purposes of this section the expression “appropriate Government” means, —
(a) in cases where the sentence is a sentence of death or is for an offence against any law relating
to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends, the Central Government; and
(b) in cases where the sentence (whether of death or not) is for an offence against any law
relating to a matter to which the executive power of the State extends, the Government of the State
within which the offender is sentenced.
6. Fractions of terms of punishment.—In calculating fractions of terms of punishment,
imprisonment for life shall be reckoned as equivalent to imprisonment for twenty years unless otherwise
provided.
7. Sentence may be (in certain cases of imprisonment) wholly or partly rigorous or simple.—In
every case in which an offender is punishable with imprisonment which may be of either description, it
shall be competent to the Court which sentences such offender to direct in the sentence that such
imprisonment shall be wholly rigorous, or that such imprisonment shall be wholly simple, or that any part
of such imprisonment shall be rigorous and the rest simple.
8. Amount of fine, liability in default of payment of fine, etc.—(1) Where no sum is expressed to
which a fine may extend, the amount of fine to which the offender is liable is unlimited, but shall not be
excessive.
(2) In every case of an offence—
(a) punishable with imprisonment as well as fine, in which the offender is sentenced to a fine,
whether with or without imprisonment;
(b) punishable with imprisonment or fine, or with fine only, in which the offender is sentenced to
a fine,
it shall be competent to the Court which sentences such offender to direct by the sentence that, in default
of payment of the fine, the offender shall suffer imprisonment for a certain term, in which imprisonment
shall be in excess of any other imprisonment to which he may have been sentenced or to which he may be
liable under a commutation of a sentence.
(3) The term for which the Court directs the offender to be imprisoned in default of payment of a fine
shall not exceed one-fourth of the term of imprisonment which is the maximum fixed for the offence, if
the offence be punishable with imprisonment as well as fine.
(4) The imprisonment which the Court imposes in default of payment of a fine or in default of
community service may be of any description to which the offender might have been sentenced for the
offence.
(5) If the offence is punishable with fine or community service, the imprisonment which the Court
imposes in default of payment of the fine or in default of community service shall be simple, and the term
for which the Court directs the offender to be imprisoned, in default of payment of fine or in default of
community service, shall not exceed,—
21
(a) two months when the amount of the fine does not exceed five thousand rupees;
(b) four months when the amount of the fine does not exceed ten thousand rupees; and
(c) one year in any other case.
(6) (a) The imprisonment which is imposed in default of payment of a fine shall terminate whenever
that fine is either paid or levied by process of law;
(b) If, before the expiration of the term of imprisonment fixed in default of payment, such a
proportion of the fine be paid or levied that the term of imprisonment suffered in default of payment is
not less than proportional to the part of the fine still unpaid, the imprisonment shall terminate.
Illustration.
A is sentenced to a fine of one thousand rupees and to four months’ imprisonment in default of
payment. Here, if seven hundred and fifty rupees of the fine be paid or levied before the expiration of one
month of the imprisonment, A will be discharged as soon as the first month has expired. If seven hundred
and fifty rupees be paid or levied at the time of the expiration of the first month, or at any later time while
A continues in imprisonment, A will be immediately discharged. If five hundred rupees of the fine be
paid or levied before the expiration of two months of the imprisonment, A will be discharged as soon as
the two months are completed. If five hundred rupees be paid or levied at the time of the expiration of
those two months, or at any later time while A continues in imprisonment, A will be immediately
discharged.
(7) The fine, or any part thereof which remains unpaid, may be levied at any time within six years
after the passing of the sentence, and if, under the sentence, the offender be liable to imprisonment for a
longer period than six years, then at any time previous to the expiration of that period; and the death of
the offender does not discharge from the liability any property which would, after his death, be legally
liable for his debts.
9. Limit of punishment of offence made up of several offences.—(1) Where anything which is an
offence is made up of parts, any of which parts is itself an offence, the offender shall not be punished
with the punishment of more than one of such his offences, unless it be so expressly provided.
(2) Where—
(a) anything is an offence falling within two or more separate definitions of any law in force for
the time being by which offences are defined or punished; or
(b) several acts, of which one or more than one would by itself or themselves constitute an
offence, constitute, when combined, a different offence,
the offender shall not be punished with a more severe punishment than the Court which tries him could
award for any one of such offences.
Illustrations.
(a) A gives Z fifty strokes with a stick. Here A may have committed the offence of voluntarily
causing hurt to Z by the whole beating, and also by each of the blows which make up the whole beating.
If A were liable to punishment for every blow, he might be imprisoned for fifty years, one for each blow.
But he is liable only to one punishment for the whole beating.
(b) But, if, while A is beating Z, Y interferes, and A intentionally strikes Y, here, as the blow given to
Y is no part of the act whereby A voluntarily causes hurt to Z, A is liable to one punishment for
voluntarily causing hurt to Z, and to another for the blow given to Y.
10. Punishment of person guilty of one of several offences, judgment stating that it is doubtful
of which.—In all cases in which judgment is given that a person is guilty of one of several offences
specified in the judgment, but that it is doubtful of which of these offences he is guilty, the offender shall
be punished for the offence for which the lowest punishment is provided if the same punishment is not
provided for all.
22
11. Solitary confinement.—Whenever any person is convicted of an offence for which under this
Sanhita the Court has power to sentence him to rigorous imprisonment, the Court may, by its sentence,
order that the offender shall be kept in solitary confinement for any portion or portions of the
imprisonment to which he is sentenced, not exceeding three months in the whole, according to the
following scale, namely: —
(a) a time not exceeding one month if the term of imprisonment shall not exceed six months;
(b) a time not exceeding two months if the term of imprisonment shall exceed six months and
shall not exceed one year;
(c) a time not exceeding three months if the term of imprisonment shall exceed one year.
12. Limit of solitary confinement.—In executing a sentence of solitary confinement, such
confinement shall in no case exceed fourteen days at a time, with intervals between the periods of solitary
confinement of not less duration than such periods; and when the imprisonment awarded shall exceed
three months, the solitary confinement shall not exceed seven days in any one month of the whole
imprisonment awarded, with intervals between the periods of solitary confinement of not less duration
than such periods.
13. Enhanced punishment for certain offences after previous conviction.—Whoever, having been
convicted by a Court in India, of an offence punishable under Chapter X or Chapter XVII of this Sanhita
with imprisonment of either description for a term of three years or upwards, shall be guilty of any
offence punishable under either of those Chapters with like imprisonment for the like term, shall be
subject for every such subsequent offence to imprisonment for life, or to imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to ten years.
CHAPTER III
GENERAL EXCEPTIONS
14. Act done by a person bound, or by mistake of fact believing himself bound, by law.—
Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is, or who by reason of a mistake of fact and not by
reason of a mistake of law in good faith believes himself to be, bound by law to do it.
Illustrations.
(a) A, a soldier, fires on a mob by the order of his superior officer, in conformity with the
commands of the law. A has committed no offence.
(b) A, an officer of a Court, being ordered by that Court to arrest Y, and, after due enquiry,
believing Z to be Y, arrests Z. A has committed no offence.
15. Act of Judge when acting judicially.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a Judge when
acting judicially in the exercise of any power which is, or which in good faith he believes to be, given to
him by law.
16. Act done pursuant to judgment or order of Court.—Nothing which is done in pursuance of, or
which is warranted by the judgment or order of, a Court; if done whilst such judgment or order remains in
force, is an offence, notwithstanding the Court may have had no jurisdiction to pass such judgment or
order, provided the person doing the act in good faith believes that the Court had such jurisdiction.
17. Act done by a person justified, or by mistake of fact believing himself justified, by law.—
Nothing is an offence which is done by any person who is justified by law, or who by reason of a mistake
of fact and not by reason of a mistake of law in good faith, believes himself to be justified by law, in
doing it.
23
Illustration.
A sees Z commit what appears to A to be a murder. A, in the exercise, to the best of his judgment
exerted in good faith, of the power which the law gives to all persons of apprehending murderers in the
fact, seizes Z, in order to bring Z before the proper authorities. A has committed no offence, though it
may turn out that Z was acting in self-defence.
18. Accident in doing a lawful act.—Nothing is an offence which is done by accident or misfortune,
and without any criminal intention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner by lawful
means and with proper care and caution.
Illustration.
A is at work with a hatchet; the head flies off and kills a man who is standing by. Here, if there was
no want of proper caution on the part of A, his act is excusable and not an offence.
19. Act likely to cause harm, but done without criminal intent, and to prevent other harm.—
Nothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause
harm, if it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in good faith for the purpose of
preventing or avoiding other harm to person or property.
Explanation.—It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was
of such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the act with the knowledge that
it was likely to cause harm.
Illustrations.
(a) A, the captain of a vessel, suddenly and without any fault or negligence on his part, finds himself
in such a position that, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a boat B, with twenty
or thirty passengers on board, unless he changes the course of his vessel, and that, by changing his
course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C with only two passengers on board, which he may
possibly clear. Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the boat C and in good faith
for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence,
though he may run down the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be
found as a matter of fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in
incurring the risk of running down the boat C.
(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading. He does
this with the intention in good faith of saving human life or property. Here, if it be found that the harm to
be prevented was of such a nature and so imminent as to excuse A’s act, A is not guilty of the offence.
20. Act of a child under seven years of age.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a child under
seven years of age.
21. Act of a child above seven and under twelve years of age of immature understanding.—
Nothing is an offence which is done by a child above seven years of age and under twelve years of age,
who has not attained sufficient maturity of understanding to judge of the nature and consequences of his
conduct on that occasion.
22. Act of a person of unsound mind.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the
time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that
he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law.
23. Act of a person incapable of judgment by reason of intoxication caused against his will.—
Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by reason of intoxication,
incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong, or contrary to law;
provided that the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or against
his will.
24. Offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge committed by one who is intoxicated.—
In cases where an act done is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge or intent, a person
who does the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the same knowledge
24
as he would have had if he had not been intoxicated, unless the thing which intoxicated him was
administered to him without his knowledge or against his will.
25. Act not intended and not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, done by
consent.—Nothing which is not intended to cause death, or grievous hurt, and which is not known by the
doer to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause,
or be intended by the doer to cause, to any person, above eighteen years of age, who has given consent,
whether express or implied, to suffer that harm; or by reason of any harm which it may be known by the
doer to be likely to cause to any such person who has consented to take the risk of that harm.
Illustration.
A and Z agree to fence with each other for amusement. This agreement implies the consent of each to
suffer any harm which, in the course of such fencing, may be caused without foul play; and if A, while
playing fairly, hurts Z, A commits no offence.
26. Act not intended to cause death, done by consent in good faith for person’s benefit.—
Nothing, which is not intended to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or
be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any person for whose
benefit it is done in good faith, and who has given a consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that
harm, or to take the risk of that harm.
Illustration.
A, a surgeon, knowing that a particular operation is likely to cause the death of Z, who suffers under
the painful complaint, but not intending to cause Z’s death, and intending, in good faith, Z’s benefit,
performs that operation on Z, with Z’s consent. A has committed no offence.
27. Act done in good faith for benefit of child or person of unsound mind, by, or by consent of
guardian.—Nothing which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under twelve years of age, or
person of unsound mind, by, or by consent, either express or implied, of the guardian or other person
having lawful charge of that person, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be
intended by the doer to cause or be known by the doer to be likely to cause to that person:
Provided that this exception shall not extend to—
(a) the intentional causing of death, or to the attempting to cause death;
(b) the doing of anything which the person doing it knows to be likely to cause death, for any
purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or
infirmity;
(c) the voluntary causing of grievous hurt, or to the attempting to cause grievous hurt, unless it be
for the purpose of preventing death or grievous hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or
infirmity;
(d) the abetment of any offence, to the committing of which offence it would not extend.
Illustration.
A, in good faith, for his child’s benefit without his child’s consent, has his child cut for the stone by a
surgeon knowing it to be likely that the operation will cause the child’s death, but not intending to cause
the child’s death. A is within the exception, in as much as his object was the cure of the child.
28. Consent known to be given under fear or misconception.—A consent is not such a consent as
is intended by any section of this Sanhita,—
(a) if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or under a misconception of fact, and
if the person doing the act knows, or has reason to believe, that the consent was given in consequence
of such fear or misconception; or
(b) if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, or intoxication, is unable
to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent; or
25
(c) unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a person who is under
twelve years of age.
29. Exclusion of acts which are offences independently of harm caused.—The exceptions in
sections 25, 26 and 27 do not extend to acts which are offences independently of any harm which they
may cause, or be intended to cause, or be known to be likely to cause, to the person giving the consent, or
on whose behalf the consent is given.
Illustration.
Causing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the woman) is
an offence independently of any harm which it may cause or be intended to cause to the woman.
Therefore, it is not an offence “by reason of such harm”; and the consent of the woman or of her guardian
to the causing of such miscarriage does not justify the act.
30. Act done in good faith for benefit of a person without consent.—Nothing is an offence by
reason of any harm which it may cause to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even
without that person’s consent, if the circumstances are such that it is impossible for that person to signify
consent, or if that person is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in lawful
charge of him from whom it is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit:
Provided that this exception shall not extend to—
(a) the intentional causing of death, or the attempting to cause death;
(b) the doing of anything which the person doing it knows to be likely to cause death, for any
purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or
infirmity;
(c) the voluntary causing of hurt, or to the attempting to cause hurt, for any purpose other than
the preventing of death or hurt;
(d) the abetment of any offence, to the committing of which offence it would not extend.
Illustrations.
(1) Z is thrown from his horse, and is insensible. A, a surgeon, finds that Z requires to be trepanned.
A, not intending Z’s death, but in good faith, for Z’s benefit, performs the trepan before Z recovers his
power of judging for himself. A has committed no offence.
(2) Z is carried off by a tiger. A fires at the tiger knowing it to be likely that the shot may kill Z, but
not intending to kill Z, and in good faith intending Z’s benefit. A’s bullet gives Z a mortal wound. A has
committed no offence.
(3) A, a surgeon, sees a child suffer an accident which is likely to prove fatal unless an operation be
immediately performed. There is no time to apply to the child’s guardian. A performs the operation in
spite of the entreaties of the child, intending, in good faith, the child’s benefit. A has committed no
offence.
(4) A is in a house which is on fire, with Z, a child. People below hold out a blanket. A drops the
child from the house top, knowing it to be likely that the fall may kill the child, but not intending to kill
the child, and intending, in good faith, the child’s benefit. Here, even if the child is killed by the fall, A
has committed no offence.
Explanation.—Mere pecuniary benefit is not benefit within the meaning of sections 26, 27 and this
section.
31. Communication made in good faith.—No communication made in good faith is an offence by
reason of any harm to the person to whom it is made, if it is made for the benefit of that person.
26
Illustration.
A, a surgeon, in good faith, communicates to a patient his opinion that he cannot live. The patient
dies in consequence of the shock. A has committed no offence, though he knew it to be likely that the
communication might cause the patient’s death.
32. Act to which a person is compelled by threats.—Except murder, and offences against the State
punishable with death, nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by
threats, which, at the time of doing it, reasonably cause the apprehension that instant death to that person
will otherwise be the consequence:
Provided that the person doing the act did not of his own accord, or from a reasonable apprehension
of harm to himself short of instant death, place himself in the situation by which he became subject to
such constraint.
Explanation 1.—A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a threat of being beaten, joins a
gang of dacoits, knowing their character, is not entitled to the benefit of this exception, on the ground of
his having been compelled by his associates to do anything that is an offence by law.
Explanation 2.—A person seized by a gang of dacoits, and forced, by threat of instant death, to do a
thing which is an offence by law; for example, a smith compelled to take his tools and to force the door
of a house for the dacoits to enter and plunder it, is entitled to the benefit of this exception.
33. Act causing slight harm.—Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended to
cause, or that it is known to be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is so slight that no person of
ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm.
Of right of private defence
34. Things done in private defence.—Nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the
right of private defence.
35. Right of private defence of body and of property.—Every person has a right, subject to the
restrictions contained in section 37, to defend—
(a) his own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting the human
body;
(b) the property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other person, against any
act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass, or
which is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass.
36. Right of private defence against act of a person of unsound mind, etc.—When an act, which
would otherwise be a certain offence, is not that offence, by reason of the youth, the want of maturity of
understanding, the unsoundness of mind or the intoxication of the person doing that act, or by reason of
any misconception on the part of that person, every person has the same right of private defence against
that act which he would have if the act were that offence.
Illustrations.
(a) Z, a person of unsound mind, attempts to kill A; Z is guilty of no offence. But A has the same
right of private defence which he would have if Z were sane.
(b) A enters by night a house which he is legally entitled to enter. Z, in good faith, taking A for a
house-breaker, attacks A. Here Z, by attacking A under this misconception, commits no offence. But A
has the same right of private defence against Z, which he would have if Z were not acting under that
misconception.
37. Acts against which there is no right of private defence.—(1) There is no right of private
defence, —
(a) against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt,
if done, or attempted to be done, by a public servant acting in good faith under colour of his office,
though that act, may not be strictly justifiable by law;
27
(b) against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt,
if done, or attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant acting in good faith under colour
of his office, though that direction may not be strictly justifiable by law;
(c) in cases in which there is time to have recourse to the protection of the public authorities.
(2) The right of private defence in no case extends to the inflicting of more harm than it is necessary
to inflict for the purpose of defence.
Explanation 1.—A person is not deprived of the right of private defence against an act done, or
attempted to be done, by a public servant, as such, unless he knows or has reason to believe, that the
person doing the act is such public servant.
Explanation 2.—A person is not deprived of the right of private defence against an act done, or
attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant, unless he knows, or has reason to believe, that
the person doing the act is acting by such direction, or unless such person states the authority under which
he acts, or if he has authority in writing, unless he produces such authority, if demanded.
38. When right of private defence of body extends to causing death.—The right of private
defence of the body extends, under the restrictions specified in section 37, to the voluntary causing of
death or of any other harm to the assailant, if the offence which occasions the exercise of the right be of
any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:—
(a) such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that death will otherwise be the
consequence of such assault;
(b) such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise be
the consequence of such assault;
(c) an assault with the intention of committing rape;
(d) an assault with the intention of gratifying unnatural lust;
(e) an assault with the intention of kidnapping or abducting;
(f) an assault with the intention of wrongfully confining a person, under circumstances which
may reasonably cause him to apprehend that he will be unable to have recourse to the public
authorities for his release;
(g) an act of throwing or administering acid or an attempt to throw or administer acid which may
reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise be the consequence of such act.
39. When such right extends to causing any harm other than death.—If the offence be not of any
of the descriptions specified in section 38, the right of private defence of the body does not extend to the
voluntary causing of death to the assailant, but does extend, under the restrictions specified in section 37,
to the voluntary causing to the assailant of any harm other than death.
40. Commencement and continuance of right of private defence of body.—The right of private
defence of the body commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises from
an attempt or threat to commit the offence though the offence may not have been committed; and it
continues as long as such apprehension of danger to the body continues.
41. When right of private defence of property extends to causing death.—The right of private
defence of property extends, under the restrictions specified in section 37, to the voluntary causing of
death or of any other harm to the wrong-doer, if the offence, the committing of which, or the attempting
to commit which, occasions the exercise of the right, be an offence of any of the descriptions hereinafter
enumerated, namely: —
(a) robbery;
(b) house-breaking after sunset and before sunrise;
(c) mischief by fire or any explosive substance committed on any building, tent or vessel, which
building, tent or vessel is used as a human dwelling, or as a place for the custody of property;
28
(d) theft, mischief, or house-trespass, under such circumstances as may reasonably cause
apprehension that death or grievous hurt will be the consequence, if such right of private defence is
not exercised.
42. When such right extends to causing any harm other than death.—If the offence, the
committing of which, or the attempting to commit which occasions the exercise of the right of private
defence, be theft, mischief, or criminal trespass, not of any of the descriptions specified in section 41, that
right does not extend to the voluntary causing of death, but does extend, subject to the restrictions
specified in section 37, to the voluntary causing to the wrong-doer of any harm other than death.
