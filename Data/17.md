PART II 
CHAPTER II 
RELEVANCY OF FACTS 
3. Evidence may be given of facts in issue and relevant facts.— Evidence may be given in any suit 
or proceeding of the existence or non-existence of every fact in issue and of such other facts as are 
hereinafter declared to be relevant, and of no others. 
Explanation.—This section shall not enable any person to give evidence of a fact which he is 
disentitled to prove by any provision of the law for the time being in force relating to civil procedure. 
Illustrations. 
(a) A is tried for the murder of B by beating him with a club with the intention of causing his death. 
At A’s trial the following facts are in issue:— 
A’s beating B with the club; 
A’s causing B’s death by such beating; 
A’s intention to cause B’s death. 
(b) A suitor does not bring with him, and have in readiness for production at the first hearing of the 
case, a bond on which he relies. This section does not enable him to produce the bond or prove its 
contents at a subsequent stage of the proceedings, otherwise than in accordance with the conditions 
prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908). 
Closely connected facts 
4. Relevancy of facts forming part of same transaction.—Facts which, though not in issue, are so 
connected with a fact in issue or a relevant fact as to form part of the same transaction, are relevant, 
whether they occurred at the same time and place or at different times and places. 
Illustrations. 
(a) A is accused of the murder of B by beating him. Whatever was said or done by A or B or the 
bystanders at the beating, or so shortly before or after it as to form part of the transaction, is a relevant 
fact. 
(b) A is accused of waging war against the Government of India by taking part in an armed 
insurrection in which property is destroyed, troops are attacked and jails are broken open. The occurrence 
of these facts is relevant, as forming part of the general transaction, though A may not have been present 
at all of them. 
(c) A sues B for a libel contained in a letter forming part of a correspondence. Letters between the 
parties relating to the subject out of which the libel arose, and forming part of the correspondence in 
which it is contained, are relevant facts, though they do not contain the libel itself. 
(d) The question is, whether certain goods ordered from B were delivered to A. The goods were 
delivered to several intermediate persons successively. Each delivery is a relevant fact. 
5. Facts which are occasion, cause or effect of facts in issue or relevant facts.— Facts which are 
the occasion, cause or effect, immediate or otherwise, of relevant facts, or facts in issue, or which 
constitute the state of things under which they happened, or which afforded an opportunity for their 
occurrence or transaction, are relevant. 
10 
Illustrations. 
(a) The question is, whether A robbed B. The facts that, shortly before the robbery, B went to a fair 
with money in his possession, and that he showed it, or mentioned the fact that he had it, to third persons, 
are relevant. 
(b) The question is, whether A murdered B. Marks on the ground, produced by a struggle at or near 
the place where the murder was committed, are relevant facts. 
(c) The question is, whether A poisoned B. The state of B's health before the symptoms ascribed to 
poison, and habits of B, known to A, which afforded an opportunity for the administration of poison, are 
relevant facts. 
6. Motive, preparation and previous or subsequent conduct.—(1) Any fact is relevant which 
shows or constitutes a motive or preparation for any fact in issue or relevant fact. 
(2) The conduct of any party, or of any agent to any party, to any suit or proceeding, in reference to 
such suit or proceeding, or in reference to any fact in issue therein or relevant thereto, and the conduct of 
any person, an offence against whom is the subject of any proceeding, is relevant, if such conduct 
influences or is influenced by any fact in issue or relevant fact, and whether it was previous or subsequent 
thereto. 
Explanation 1.—The word “conduct” in this section does not include statements, unless those 
statements accompany and explain acts other than statements; but this explanation is not to affect the 
relevancy of statements under any other section of this Adhiniyam. 
Explanation 2.—When the conduct of any person is relevant, any statement made to him or in his 
presence and hearing, which affects such conduct, is relevant. 
Illustrations. 
(a) A is tried for the murder of B. The facts that A murdered C, that B knew that A had murdered C, 
and that B had tried to extort money from A by threatening to make his knowledge public, are relevant. 
(b) A sues B upon a bond for the payment of money. B denies the making of the bond. The fact that, 
at the time when the bond was alleged to be made, B required money for a particular purpose, is relevant. 
(c) A is tried for the murder of B by poison. The fact that, before the death of B, A procured poison 
similar to that which was administered to B, is relevant. 
(d) The question is, whether a certain document is the will of A. The facts that, not long before, the 
date of the alleged will, A made inquiry into matters to which the provisions of the alleged will relate; 
that he consulted advocates in reference to making the will, and that he caused drafts of other wills to be 
prepared, of which he did not approve, are relevant. 
(e) A is accused of a crime. The facts that, either before, or at the time of, or after the alleged crime, 
A provided evidence which would tend to give to the facts of the case an appearance favourable to 
himself, or that he destroyed or concealed evidence, or prevented the presence or procured the absence of 
persons who might have been witnesses, or suborned persons to give false evidence respecting it, are 
relevant. 
(f) The question is, whether A robbed B. The facts that, after B was robbed, C said in A's presence— 
“the police are coming to look for the person who robbed B”, and that immediately afterwards A ran 
away, are relevant. 
(g) The question is, whether A owes B ten thousand rupees. The facts that A asked C to lend him 
money, and that D said to C in A's presence and hearing—“I advise you not to trust A, for he owes B ten 
thousand rupees”, and that A went away without making any answer, are relevant facts. 
(h) The question is, whether A committed a crime. The fact that A absconded, after receiving a letter, 
warning A that inquiry was being made for the criminal, and the contents of the letter, are relevant. 
11 
(i) A is accused of a crime. The facts that, after the commission of the alleged crime, A absconded, or 
was in possession of property or the proceeds of property acquired by the crime, or attempted to conceal 
things which were or might have been used in committing it, are relevant. 
(j) The question is, whether A was raped. The fact that, shortly after the alleged rape, A made a 
complaint relating to the crime, the circumstances under which, and the terms in which, the complaint 
was made, are relevant. The fact that, without making a complaint, A said that A had been raped is not 
relevant as conduct under this section, though it may be relevant as a dying declaration under clause (a) 
of section 26, or as corroborative evidence under section 160. 
(k) The question is, whether A was robbed. The fact that, soon after the alleged robbery, A made a 
complaint relating to the offence, the circumstances under which, and the terms in which, the complaint 
was made, are relevant. The fact that A said he had been robbed, without making any complaint, is not 
relevant, as conduct under this section, though it may be relevant as a dying declaration under clause (a) 
of section 26, or as corroborative evidence under section 160. 
7. Facts necessary to explain or introduce fact in issue or relevant facts.—Facts necessary to 
explain or introduce a fact in issue or relevant fact, or which support or rebut an inference suggested by a 
fact in issue or a relevant fact, or which establish the identity of anything, or person whose identity, is 
relevant, or fix the time or place at which any fact in issue or relevant fact happened, or which show the 
relation of parties by whom any such fact was transacted, are relevant in so far as they are necessary for 
that purpose. 
Illustrations. 
(a) The question is, whether a given document is the will of A. The state of A's property and of his 
family at the date of the alleged will may be relevant facts. 
(b) A sues B for a libel imputing disgraceful conduct to A; B affirms that the matter alleged to be 
libellous is true. The position and relations of the parties at the time when the libel was published may be 
relevant facts as introductory to the facts in issue. The particulars of a dispute between A and B about a 
matter unconnected with the alleged libel are irrelevant, though the fact that there was a dispute may be 
relevant if it affected the relations between A and B. 
(c) A is accused of a crime. The fact that, soon after the commission of the crime, A absconded from 
his house, is relevant under section 6, as conduct subsequent to and affected by facts in issue. The fact 
that, at the time when he left home, A had sudden and urgent business at the place to which he went, is 
relevant, as tending to explain the fact that he left home suddenly. The details of the business on which he 
left are not relevant, except in so far as they are necessary to show that the business was sudden and 
urgent. 
(d) A sues B for inducing C to break a contract of service made by him with A. C, on leaving A's 
service, says to A—“I am leaving you because B has made me a better offer”. This statement is a relevant 
fact as explanatory of C's conduct, which is relevant as a fact in issue. 
(e) A, accused of theft, is seen to give the stolen property to B, who is seen to give it to A's wife. B 
says as he delivers it—“A says you are to hide this”. B's statement is relevant as explanatory of a fact 
which is part of the transaction. 
(f) A is tried for a riot and is proved to have marched at the head of a mob. The cries of the mob are 
relevant as explanatory of the nature of the transaction. 
8. Things said or done by conspirator in reference to common design.—Where there is 
reasonable ground to believe that two or more persons have conspired together to commit an offence or 
an actionable wrong, anything said, done or written by any one of such persons in reference to their 
common intention, after the time when such intention was first entertained by any one of them, is a 
relevant fact as against each of the persons believed to be so conspiring, as well for the purpose of 
proving the existence of the conspiracy as for the purpose of showing that any such person was a party to 
it. 
12 
Illustration. 
Reasonable ground exists for believing that A has joined in a conspiracy to wage war against the 
State. 
The facts that B procured arms in Europe for the purpose of the conspiracy, C collected money in 
Kolkata for a like object, D persuaded persons to join the conspiracy in Mumbai, E published writings 
advocating the object in view at Agra, and F transmitted from Delhi to G at Singapore the money which 
C had collected at Kolkata, and the contents of a letter written by H giving an account of the conspiracy, 
are each relevant, both to prove the existence of the conspiracy, and to prove A's complicity in it, 
although he may have been ignorant of all of them, and although the persons by whom they were done 
were strangers to him, and although they may have taken place before he joined the conspiracy or after he 
left it. 
9. When facts not otherwise relevant become relevant.—Facts not otherwise relevant are 
relevant— 
(1) if they are inconsistent with any fact in issue or relevant fact; 
(2) if by themselves or in connection with other facts they make the existence or non-existence of 
any fact in issue or relevant fact highly probable or improbable. 
Illustrations. 
(a) The question is, whether A committed a crime at Chennai on a certain day. The fact that, on that 
day, A was at Ladakh is relevant. The fact that, near the time when the crime was committed, A was at a 
distance from the place where it was committed, which would render it highly improbable, though not 
impossible, that he committed it, is relevant. 
(b) The question is, whether A committed a crime. The circumstances are such that the crime must 
have been committed either by A, B, C or D. Every fact which shows that the crime could have been 
committed by no one else, and that it was not committed by either B, C or D, is relevant. 
10. Facts tending to enable Court to determine amount are relevant in suits for damages.—In 
suits in which damages are claimed, any fact which will enable the Court to determine the amount of 
damages which ought to be awarded, is relevant. 
11. Facts relevant when right or custom is in question.—Where the question is as to the existence 
of any right or custom, the following facts are relevant— 
(a) any transaction by which the right or custom in question was created, claimed, modified, 
recognised, asserted or denied, or which was inconsistent with its existence; 
(b) particular instances in which the right or custom was claimed, recognised or exercised, or in 
which its exercise was disputed, asserted or departed from. 
Illustration. 
The question is, whether A has a right to a fishery. A deed conferring the fishery on A's ancestors, a 
mortgage of the fishery by A's father, a subsequent grant of the fishery by A's father, irreconcilable with 
the mortgage, particular instances in which A's father exercised the right, or in which the exercise of the 
right was stopped by A's neighbours, are relevant facts. 
12. Facts showing existence of state of mind, or of body or bodily feeling.—Facts showing the 
existence of any state of mind, such as intention, knowledge, good faith, negligence, rashness, ill-will or 
goodwill towards any particular person, or showing the existence of any state of body or bodily feeling, 
are relevant, when the existence of any such state of mind or body or bodily feeling is in issue or relevant. 
Explanation 1.—A fact relevant as showing the existence of a relevant state of mind must show that 
the state of mind exists, not generally, but in reference to the particular matter in question. 
Explanation 2.—But where, upon the trial of a person accused of an offence, the previous 
commission by the accused of an offence is relevant within the meaning of this section, the previous 
conviction of such person shall also be a relevant fact. 
13 
Illustrations. 
(a) A is accused of receiving stolen goods knowing them to be stolen. It is proved that he was in 
possession of a particular stolen article. The fact that, at the same time, he was in possession of many 
other stolen articles is relevant, as tending to show that he knew each and all of the articles of which he 
was in possession to be stolen. 
(b) A is accused of fraudulently delivering to another person a counterfeit currency which, at the time 
when he delivered it, he knew to be counterfeit. The fact that, at the time of its delivery, A was possessed 
of a number of other pieces of counterfeit currency is relevant. The fact that A had been previously 
convicted of delivering to another person as genuine a counterfeit currency knowing it to be counterfeit is 
relevant. 
(c) A sues B for damage done by a dog of B's, which B knew to be ferocious. The fact that the dog 
had previously bitten X, Y and Z, and that they had made complaints to B, are relevant. 
(d) The question is, whether A, the acceptor of a bill of exchange, knew that the name of the payee 
was fictitious. The fact that A had accepted other bills drawn in the same manner before they could have 
been transmitted to him by the payee if the payee had been a real person, is relevant, as showing that A 
knew that the payee was a fictitious person. 
(e) A is accused of defaming B by publishing an imputation intended to harm the reputation of B. 
The fact of previous publications by A respecting B, showing ill-will on the part of A towards B is 
relevant, as proving A's intention to harm B's reputation by the particular publication in question. The 
facts that there was no previous quarrel between A and B, and that A repeated the matter complained of 
as he heard it, are relevant, as showing that A did not intend to harm the reputation of B. 
(f) A is sued by B for fraudulently representing to B that C was solvent, whereby B, being induced to 
trust C, who was insolvent, suffered loss. The fact that, at the time when A represented C to be solvent, C 
was supposed to be solvent by his neighbours and by persons dealing with him, is relevant, as showing 
that A made the representation in good faith. 
(g) A is sued by B for the price of work done by B, upon a house of which A is owner, by the order 
of C, a contractor. A's defence is that B's contract was with C. The fact that A paid C for the work in 
question is relevant, as proving that A did, in good faith, make over to C the management of the work in 
question, so that C was in a position to contract with B on C's own account, and not as agent for A. 
(h) A is accused of the dishonest misappropriation of property which he had found, and the question 
is whether, when he appropriated it, he believed in good faith that the real owner could not be found. The 
fact that public notice of the loss of the property had been given in the place where A was, is relevant, as 
showing that A did not in good faith believe that the real owner of the property could not be found. The 
fact that A knew, or had reason to believe, that the notice was given fraudulently by C, who had heard of 
the loss of the property and wished to set up a false claim to it, is relevant, as showing that the fact that A 
knew of the notice did not disprove A's good faith. 
(i) A is charged with shooting at B with intent to kill him. In order to show A's intent, the fact of A's 
having previously shot at B may be proved. 
(j) A is charged with sending threatening letters to B. Threatening letters previously sent by A to B 
may be proved, as showing the intention of the letters. 
(k) The question is, whether A has been guilty of cruelty towards B, his wife. Expressions of their 
feeling towards each other shortly before or after the alleged cruelty are relevant facts. 
(l) The question is, whether A's death was caused by poison. Statements made by A during his illness 
as to his symptoms are relevant facts. 
(m) The question is, what was the state of A's health at the time when an assurance on his life was 
effected. Statements made by A as to the state of his health at or near the time in question are relevant 
facts. 
14 
(n) A sues B for negligence in providing him with a car for hire not reasonably fit for use, whereby A 
was injured. The fact that B's attention was drawn on other occasions to the defect of that particular car is 
relevant. The fact that B was habitually negligent about the cars which he let to hire is irrelevant. 
(o) A is tried for the murder of B by intentionally shooting him dead. The fact that A on other 
occasions shot at B is relevant as showing his intention to shoot B. The fact that A was in the habit of 
shooting at people with intent to murder them is irrelevant. 
(p) A is tried for a crime. The fact that he said something indicating an intention to commit that 
particular crime is relevant. The fact that he said something indicating a general disposition to commit 
crimes of that class is irrelevant. 
13. Facts bearing on question whether act was accidental or intentional.—When there is a 
question whether an act was accidental or intentional, or done with a particular knowledge or intention, 
the fact that such act formed part of a series of similar occurrences, in each of which the person doing the 
act was concerned, is relevant. 
Illustrations. 
(a) A is accused of burning down his house in order to obtain money for which it is insured. The facts 
that A lived in several houses successively each of which he insured, in each of which a fire occurred, 
and after each of which fires A received payment from a different insurance company, are relevant, as 
tending to show that the fires were not accidental. 
(b) A is employed to receive money from the debtors of B. It is A's duty to make entries in a book 
showing the amounts received by him. He makes an entry showing that on a particular occasion he 
received less than he really did receive. The question is, whether this false entry was accidental or 
intentional. The facts that other entries made by A in the same book are false, and that the false entry is in 
each case in favour of A, are relevant. 
(c) A is accused of fraudulently delivering to B a counterfeit currency. The question is, whether the 
delivery of the currency was accidental. The facts that, soon before or soon after the delivery to B, A 
delivered counterfeit currency to C, D and E are relevant, as showing that the delivery to B was not 
accidental. 
14. Existence of course of business when relevant.—When there is a question whether a particular 
act was done, the existence of any course of business, according to which it naturally would have been 
done, is a relevant fact. 
Illustrations. 
(a) The question is, whether a particular letter was dispatched. The facts that it was the ordinary 
course of business for all letters put in a certain place to be carried to the post, and that particular letter 
was put in that place are relevant. 
(b) The question is, whether a particular letter reached A. The facts that it was posted in due course, 
and was not returned through the Return Letter Office, are relevant. 
Admissions 
15. Admission defined.—An admission is a statement, oral or documentary or contained in 
electronic form, which suggests any inference as to any fact in issue or relevant fact, and which is made 
by any of the persons, and under the circumstances, hereinafter mentioned. 
16. Admission by party to proceeding or his agent.—(1) Statements made by a party to the 
proceeding, or by an agent to any such party, whom the Court regards, under the circumstances of the 
case, as expressly or impliedly authorised by him to make them, are admissions. 
(2) Statements made by— 
(i) parties to suits suing or sued in a representative character, are not admissions, unless they 
were made while the party making them held that character; or 
15 
(ii) (a) persons who have any proprietary or pecuniary interest in the subject matter of the 
proceeding, and who make the statement in their character of persons so interested; or 
(b) persons from whom the parties to the suit have derived their interest in the subject matter of 
the suit, 
are admissions, if they are made during the continuance of the interest of the persons making the 
statements. 
17. Admissions by persons whose position must be proved as against party to suit.—Statements 
made by persons whose position or liability, it is necessary to prove as against any party to the suit, are 
admissions, if such statements would be relevant as against such persons in relation to such position or 
liability in a suit brought by or against them, and if they are made whilst the person making them 
occupies such position or is subject to such liability. 
Illustration. 
A undertakes to collect rents for B. B sues A for not collecting rent due from C to B. A denies that 
rent was due from C to B. A statement by C that he owed B rent is an admission, and is a relevant fact as 
against A, if A denies that C did owe rent to B. 
18. Admissions by persons expressly referred to by party to suit.—Statements made by persons to 
whom a party to the suit has expressly referred for information in reference to a matter in dispute are 
admissions. 
Illustration. 
The question is, whether a horse sold by A to B is sound. 
A says to B— “Go and ask C, C knows all about it”. C's statement is an admission. 
19. Proof of admissions against persons making them, and by or on their behalf.—Admissions 
are relevant and may be proved as against the person who makes them, or his representative in interest; 
but they cannot be proved by or on behalf of the person who makes them or by his representative in 
interest, except in the following cases, namely:— 
(1) an admission may be proved by or on behalf of the person making it, when it is of such a 
nature that, if the person making it were dead, it would be relevant as between third persons under 
section 26; 
(2) an admission may be proved by or on behalf of the person making it, when it consists of a 
statement of the existence of any state of mind or body, relevant or in issue, made at or about the time 
when such state of mind or body existed, and is accompanied by conduct rendering its falsehood 
improbable; 
(3) an admission may be proved by or on behalf of the person making it, if it is relevant 
otherwise than as an admission. 
Illustrations. 
(a) The question between A and B is, whether a certain deed is or is not forged. A affirms that it is 
genuine, B that it is forged. A may prove a statement by B that the deed is genuine, and B may prove a 
statement by A that deed is forged; but A cannot prove a statement by himself that the deed is genuine, 
nor can B prove a statement by himself that the deed is forged. 
(b) A, the captain of a ship, is tried for casting her away. Evidence is given to show that the ship was 
taken out of her proper course. A produces a book kept by him in the ordinary course of his business 
showing observations alleged to have been taken by him from day to day, and indicating that the ship was 
not taken out of her proper course. A may prove these statements, because they would be admissible 
between third parties, if he were dead, under clause (b) of section 26. 
16 
(c) A is accused of a crime committed by him at Kolkata. He produces a letter written by himself and 
dated at Chennai on that day, and bearing the Chennai post-mark of that day. The statement in the date of 
the letter is admissible, because, if A were dead, it would be admissible under clause (b) of section 26. 
(d) A is accused of receiving stolen goods knowing them to be stolen. He offers to prove that he 
refused to sell them below their value. A may prove these statements, though they are admissions, 
because they are explanatory of conduct influenced by facts in issue. 
(e) A is accused of fraudulently having in his possession counterfeit currency which he knew to be 
counterfeit. He offers to prove that he asked a skilful person to examine the currency as he doubted 
whether it was counterfeit or not, and that person did examine it and told him it was genuine. A may 
prove these facts. 
20. When oral admissions as to contents of documents are relevant.—Oral admissions as to the 
contents of a document are not relevant, unless and until the party proposing to prove them shows that he 
is entitled to give secondary evidence of the contents of such document under the rules hereinafter 
contained, or unless the genuineness of a document produced is in question. 
21. Admissions in civil cases when relevant.—In civil cases no admission is relevant, if it is made 
either upon an express condition that evidence of it is not to be given, or under circumstances from which 
the Court can infer that the parties agreed together that evidence of it should not be given. 
Explanation.—Nothing in this section shall be taken to exempt any advocate from giving evidence of 
any matter of which he may be compelled to give evidence under sub-sections (1) and (2) of section 132. 
22. Confession caused by inducement, threat, coercion or promise, when irrelevant in criminal 
proceeding.—A confession made by an accused person is irrelevant in a criminal proceeding, if the 
making of the confession appears to the Court to have been caused by any inducement, threat, coercion or 
promise having reference to the charge against the accused person, proceeding from a person in authority 
and sufficient, in the opinion of the Court, to give the accused person grounds which would appear to him 
reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal 
nature in reference to the proceedings against him: 
Provided that if the confession is made after the impression caused by any such inducement, threat, 
coercion or promise has, in the opinion of the Court, been fully removed, it is relevant: 
Provided further that if such a confession is otherwise relevant, it does not become irrelevant merely 
because it was made under a promise of secrecy, or in consequence of a deception practised on the 
accused person for the purpose of obtaining it, or when he was drunk, or because it was made in answer 
to questions which he need not have answered, whatever may have been the form of those questions, or 
because he was not warned that he was not bound to make such confession, and that evidence of it might 
be given against him. 
23. Confession to police officer.—(1) No confession made to a police officer shall be proved as 
against a person accused of any offence. 
(2) No confession made by any person while he is in the custody of a police officer, unless it is made 
in the immediate presence of a Magistrate shall be proved against him: 
Provided that when any fact is deposed to as discovered in consequence of information received from 
a person accused of any offence, in the custody of a police officer, so much of such information, whether 
it amounts to a confession or not, as relates distinctly to the fact discovered, may be proved. 
24. Consideration of proved confession affecting person making it and others jointly under trial 
for same offence.—When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a 
confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is proved, the 
Court may take into consideration such confession as against such other person as well as against the 
person who makes such confession. 
Explanation I.—“Offence”, as used in this section, includes the abetment of, or attempt to commit, 
the offence. 
17 
Explanation II.—A trial of more persons than one held in the absence of the accused who has 
absconded or who fails to comply with a proclamation issued under section 84 of the Bharatiya Nagarik 
Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 shall be deemed to be a joint trial for the purpose of this section. 
Illustrations. 
(a) A and B are jointly tried for the murder of C. It is proved that A said—“B and I murdered C”. The 
Court may consider the effect of this confession as against B. 
(b) A is on his trial for the murder of C. There is evidence to show that C was murdered by A and B, 
and that B said— “A and I murdered C”. This statement may not be taken into consideration by the Court 
against A, as B is not being jointly tried. 
25. Admissions not conclusive proof, but may estop.—Admissions are not conclusive proof of the 
matters admitted but they may operate as estoppels under the provisions hereinafter contained. 
Statements by persons who cannot be called as witnesses 
26. Cases in which statement of relevant fact by person who is dead or cannot be found, etc., is 
relevant.—Statements, written or verbal, of relevant facts made by a person who is dead, or who cannot 
be found, or who has become incapable of giving evidence, or whose attendance cannot be procured 
without an amount of delay or expense which under the circumstances of the case appears to the Court 
unreasonable, are themselves relevant facts in the following cases, namely:— 
(a) when the statement is made by a person as to the cause of his death, or as to any of the 
circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death, in cases in which the cause of that 
person's death comes into question. Such statements are relevant whether the person who made them 
was or was not, at the time when they were made, under expectation of death, and whatever may be 
the nature of the proceeding in which the cause of his death comes into question; 
(b) when the statement was made by such person in the ordinary course of business, and in 
particular when it consists of any entry or memorandum made by him in books kept in the ordinary 
course of business, or in the discharge of professional duty; or of an acknowledgement written or 
signed by him of the receipt of money, goods, securities or property of any kind; or of a document 
used in commerce written or signed by him; or of the date of a letter or other document usually dated, 
written or signed by him; 
(c) when the statement is against the pecuniary or proprietary interest of the person making it, or 
when, if true, it would expose him or would have exposed him to a criminal prosecution or to a suit 
for damages; 
(d) when the statement gives the opinion of any such person, as to the existence of any public 
right or custom or matter of public or general interest, of the existence of which, if it existed, he 
would have been likely to be aware, and when such statement was made before any controversy as to 
such right, custom or matter had arisen; 
(e) when the statement relates to the existence of any relationship by blood, marriage or adoption 
between persons as to whose relationship by blood, marriage or adoption the person making the 
statement had special means of knowledge, and when the statement was made before the question in 
dispute was raised; 
(f) when the statement relates to the existence of any relationship by blood, marriage or adoption 
between persons deceased, and is made in any will or deed relating to the affairs of the family to 
which any such deceased person belonged, or in any family pedigree, or upon any tombstone, family 
portrait or other thing on which such statements are usually made, and when such statement was 
made before the question in dispute was raised; 
(g) when the statement is contained in any deed, will or other document which relates to any such 
transaction as is specified in clause (a) of section 11; 
(h) when the statement was made by a number of persons, and expressed feelings or impressions 
on their part relevant to the matter in question. 
18 
Illustrations. 
(a) The question is, whether A was murdered by B; or A dies of injuries received in a transaction in 
the course of which she was raped. The question is whether she was raped by B; or the question is, 
whether A was killed by B under such circumstances that a suit would lie against B by A's widow. 
Statements made by A as to the cause of his or her death, referring respectively to the murder, the rape 
and the actionable wrong under consideration, are relevant facts. 
(b) The question is as to the date of A's birth. An entry in the diary of a deceased surgeon regularly 
kept in the course of business, stating that, on a given day he attended A's mother and delivered her of a 
son, is a relevant fact. 
(c) The question is, whether A was in Nagpur on a given day. A statement in the diary of a deceased 
solicitor, regularly kept in the course of business, that on a given day the solicitor attended A at a place 
mentioned, in Nagpur, for the purpose of conferring with him upon specified business, is a relevant fact. 
(d) The question is, whether a ship sailed from Mumbai harbour on a given day. A letter written by a 
deceased member of a merchant's firm by which she was chartered to their correspondents in Chennai, to 
whom the cargo was consigned, stating that the ship sailed on a given day from Mumbai port, is a 
relevant fact. 
(e) The question is, whether rent was paid to A for certain land. A letter from A's deceased agent to 
A, saying that he had received the rent on A's account and held it at A's orders is a relevant fact. 
(f) The question is, whether A and B were legally married. The statement of a deceased clergyman 
that he married them under such circumstances that the celebration would be a crime is relevant. 
(g) The question is, whether A, a person who cannot be found, wrote a letter on a certain day. The 
fact that a letter written by him is dated on that day is relevant. 
(h) The question is, what was the cause of the wreck of a ship. A protest made by the captain, whose 
attendance cannot be procured, is a relevant fact. 
(i) The question is, whether a given road is a public way. A statement by A, a deceased headman of 
the village, that the road was public, is a relevant fact. 
(j) The question is, what was the price of grain on a certain day in a particular market. A statement of 
the price, made by a deceased business person in the ordinary course of his business, is a relevant fact. 
(k) The question is, whether A, who is dead, was the father of B. A statement by A that B was his 
son, is a relevant fact. 
(l) The question is, what was the date of the birth of A. A letter from A's deceased father to a friend, 
announcing the birth of A on a given day, is a relevant fact. 
(m) The question is, whether, and when, A and B were married. An entry in a memorandum book by 
C, the deceased father of B, of his daughter's marriage with A on a given date, is a relevant fact. 
(n) A sues B for a libel expressed in a painted caricature exposed in a shop window. The question is 
as to the similarity of the caricature and its libellous character. The remarks of a crowd of spectators on 
these points may be proved. 
27. Relevancy of certain evidence for proving, in subsequent proceeding, truth of facts therein 
stated.—Evidence given by a witness in a judicial proceeding, or before any person authorised by law to 
take it, is relevant for the purpose of proving, in a subsequent judicial proceeding, or in a later stage of the 
same judicial proceeding, the truth of the facts which it states, when the witness is dead or cannot be 
found, or is incapable of giving evidence, or is kept out of the way by the adverse party, or if his presence 
cannot be obtained without an amount of delay or expense which, under the circumstances of the case, 
the Court considers unreasonable: 
Provided that the proceeding was between the same parties or their representatives in interest; that the 
adverse party in the first proceeding had the right and opportunity to cross-examine and the questions in 
issue were substantially the same in the first as in the second proceeding. 
19 
Explanation.—A criminal trial or inquiry shall be deemed to be a proceeding between the prosecutor 
and the accused within the meaning of this section. 
Statements made under special circumstances 
28. Entries in books of account when relevant.—Entries in the books of account, including those 
maintained in an electronic form, regularly kept in the course of business are relevant whenever they refer 
to a matter into which the Court has to inquire, but such statements shall not alone be sufficient evidence 
to charge any person with liability. 
Illustration. 
A sues B for one thousand rupees, and shows entries in his account books showing B to be indebted 
to him to this amount. The entries are relevant, but are not sufficient, without other evidence, to prove the 
debt. 
29. Relevancy of entry in public record or an electronic record made in performance of duty.—
 An entry in any public or other official book, register or record or an electronic record, stating a fact in 
issue or relevant fact, and made by a public servant in the discharge of his official duty, or by any other 
person in performance of a duty specially enjoined by the law of the country in which such book, register 
or record or an electronic record, is kept, is itself a relevant fact. 
30. Relevancy of statements in maps, charts and plans.—Statements of facts in issue or relevant 
facts, made in published maps or charts generally offered for public sale, or in maps or plans made under 
the authority of the Central Government or any State Government, as to matters usually represented or 
stated in such maps, charts or plans, are themselves relevant facts. 
30. Relevancy of statements in maps, charts and plans.—Statements of facts in issue or relevant 
facts, made in published maps or charts generally offered for public sale, or in maps or plans made under 
the authority of the Central Government or any State Government, as to matters usually represented or 
stated in such maps, charts or plans, are themselves relevant facts. 
31. Relevancy of statement as to fact of public nature contained in certain Acts or 
notifications.—When the Court has to form an opinion as to the existence of any fact of a public nature, 
any statement of it, made in a recital contained in any Central Act or State Act or in a Central 
Government or State Government notification appearing in the respective Official Gazette or in any 
printed paper or in electronic or digital form purporting to be such Gazette, is a relevant fact. 
32. Relevancy of statements as to any law contained in law books including electronic or digital 
form.—When the Court has to form an opinion as to a law of any country, any statement of such law 
contained in a book purporting to be printed or published including in electronic or digital form under the 
authority of the Government of such country and to contain any such law, and any report of a ruling of 
the Courts of such country contained in a book including in electronic or digital form purporting to be a 
report of such rulings, is relevant. 
How much of a statement is to be proved 
33. What evidence to be given when statement forms part of a conversation, document, 
electronic record, book or series of letters or papers.—When any statement of which evidence is given 
forms part of a longer statement, or of a conversation or part of an isolated document, or is contained in a 
document which forms part of a book, or is contained in part of electronic record or of a connected series 
of letters or papers, evidence shall be given of so much and no more of the statement, conversation, 
document, electronic record, book or series of letters or papers as the Court considers necessary in that 
particular case to the full understanding of the nature and effect of the statement, and of the 
circumstances under which it was made. 
Judgments of Courts when relevant 
34. Previous judgments relevant to bar a second suit or trial.—The existence of any judgment, 
order or decree which by law prevents any Court from taking cognizance of a suit or holding a trial, is a 
20 
relevant fact when the question is whether such Court ought to take cognizance of such suit or to hold 
such trial. 
35. Relevancy of certain judgments in probate, etc., jurisdiction.—(1) A final judgment, order or 
decree of a competent Court or Tribunal, in the exercise of probate, matrimonial, admiralty or insolvency 
jurisdiction, which confers upon or takes away from any person any legal character, or which declares 
any person to be entitled to any such character, or to be entitled to any specific thing, not as against any 
specified person but absolutely, is relevant when the existence of any such legal character, or the title of 
any such person to any such thing, is relevant. 
(2) Such judgment, order or decree is conclusive proof that— 
(i) any legal character, which it confers accrued at the time when such judgment, order or decree 
came into operation; 
(ii) any legal character, to which it declares any such person to be entitled, accrued to that person 
at the time when such judgment, order or decree declares it to have accrued to that person; 
(iii) any legal character which it takes away from any such person ceased at the time from which 
such judgment, order or decree declared that it had ceased or should cease; and 
(iv) anything to which it declares any person to be so entitled was the property of that person at 
the time from which such judgment, order or decree declares that it had been or should be his 
property. 
36. Relevancy and effect of judgments, orders or decrees, other than those mentioned in                     
section 35.—Judgments, orders or decrees other than those mentioned in section 35 are relevant if they 
relate to matters of a public nature relevant to the enquiry; but such judgments, orders or decrees are not 
conclusive proof of that which they state. 
Illustration. 
A sues B for trespass on his land. B alleges the existence of a public right of way over the land, 
which A denies. The existence of a decree in favour of the defendant, in a suit by A against C for a 
trespass on the same land, in which C alleged the existence of the same right of way, is relevant, but it is 
not conclusive proof that the right of way exists. 
37. Judgments, etc., other than those mentioned in sections 34, 35 and 36 when relevant.—
 Judgments or orders or decrees, other than those mentioned in sections 34, 35 and 36, are irrelevant, 
unless the existence of such judgment, order or decree is a fact in issue, or is relevant under some other 
provision of this Adhiniyam. 
Illustrations. 
(a) A and B separately sue C for a libel which reflects upon each of them. C in each case says that the 
matter alleged to be libellous is true, and the circumstances are such that it is probably true in each case, 
or in neither. A obtains a decree against C for damages on the ground that C failed to make out his 
justification. The fact is irrelevant as between B and C. 
(b) A prosecutes B for stealing a cow from him. B is convicted. A afterwards sues C for the cow, 
which B had sold to him before his conviction. As between A and C, the judgment against B is irrelevant. 
(c) A has obtained a decree for the possession of land against B. C, B's son, murders A in 
consequence. The existence of the judgment is relevant, as showing motive for a crime. 
(d) A is charged with theft and with having been previously convicted of theft. The previous 
conviction is relevant as a fact in issue. 
(e) A is tried for the murder of B. The fact that B prosecuted A for libel and that A was convicted and 
sentenced is relevant under section 6 as showing the motive for the fact in issue. 
21 
38. Fraud or collusion in obtaining judgment, or incompetency of Court, may be proved.—Any 
party to a suit or other proceeding may show that any judgment, order or decree which is relevant under 
section 34, 35 or 36, and which has been proved by the adverse party, was delivered by a Court not 
competent to deliver it, or was obtained by fraud or collusion. 
Opinions of third persons when relevant 
39. Opinions of experts.—(1) When the Court has to form an opinion upon a point of foreign law or 
of science or art, or any other field, or as to identity of handwriting or finger impressions, the opinions 
upon that point of persons specially skilled in such foreign law, science or art, or any other field, or in 
questions as to identity of handwriting or finger impressions are relevant facts and such persons are called 
experts.   
Illustrations. 
(a) The question is, whether the death of A was caused by poison. The opinions of experts as to the 
symptoms produced by the poison by which A is supposed to have died, are relevant. 
(b) The question is, whether A, at the time of doing a certain act, was, by reason of unsoundness of 
mind, incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he was doing what was either wrong or contrary 
to law. The opinions of experts upon the question whether the symptoms exhibited by A commonly show 
unsoundness of mind, and whether such unsoundness of mind usually renders persons incapable of 
knowing the nature of the acts which they do, or of knowing that what they do is either wrong or contrary 
to law, are relevant. 
(c) The question is, whether a certain document was written by A. Another document is produced 
which is proved or admitted to have been written by A. The opinions of experts on the question whether 
the two documents were written by the same person or by different persons, are relevant. 
(2) When in a proceeding, the court has to form an opinion on any matter relating to any information 
transmitted or stored in any computer resource or any other electronic or digital form, the opinion of the 
Examiner of Electronic Evidence referred to in section 79A of the Information Technology Act, 2000           
(21 of 2000), is a relevant fact. 
Explanation.—For the purposes of this sub-section, an Examiner of Electronic Evidence shall be an 
expert. 
40. Facts bearing upon opinions of experts.—Facts, not otherwise relevant, are relevant if they 
support or are inconsistent with the opinions of experts, when such opinions are relevant. 
Illustrations. 
(a) The question is, whether A was poisoned by a certain poison. The fact that other persons, who 
were poisoned by that poison, exhibited certain symptoms which experts affirm or deny to be the 
symptoms of that poison, is relevant. 
(b) The question is, whether an obstruction to a harbour is caused by a certain sea-wall. The fact that 
other harbours similarly situated in other respects, but where there were no such sea-walls, began to be 
obstructed at about the same time, is relevant. 

41. Opinion as to handwriting and signature, when relevant.—(1) When the Court has to form an 
opinion as to the person by whom any document was written or signed, the opinion of any person 
acquainted with the handwriting of the person by whom it is supposed to be written or signed that it was 
or was not written or signed by that person, is a relevant fact. 
Explanation.—A person is said to be acquainted with the handwriting of another person when he has 
seen that person write, or when he has received documents purporting to be written by that person in 
answer to documents written by himself or under his authority and addressed to that person, or when, in 
the ordinary course of business, documents purporting to be written by that person have been habitually 
submitted to him. 
22 
Illustration. 
The question is, whether a given letter is in the handwriting of A, a merchant in Itanagar. B is a 
merchant in Bengaluru, who has written letters addressed to A and received letters purporting to be 
written by him. C, is B's clerk whose duty it was to examine and file B's correspondence. D is B's broker, 
to whom B habitually submitted the letters purporting to be written by A for the purpose of advising him 
thereon. The opinions of B, C and D on the question whether the letter is in the handwriting of A are 
relevant, though neither B, C nor D ever saw A write. 
(2) When the Court has to form an opinion as to the electronic signature of any person, the opinion of 
the Certifying Authority which has issued the Electronic Signature Certificate is a relevant fact. 
42. Opinion as to existence of general custom or right, when relevant.—When the Court has to 
form an opinion as to the existence of any general custom or right, the opinions, as to the existence of 
such custom or right, of persons who would be likely to know of its existence if it existed, are relevant. 
Explanation.—The expression “general custom or right” includes customs or rights common to any 
considerable class of persons. 
Illustration. 
The right of the villagers of a particular village to use the water of a particular well is a general right 
within the meaning of this section. 
43. Opinion as to usages, tenets, etc., when relevant.—When the Court has to form an opinion as 
to— 
(i) the usages and tenets of any body of men or family; 
(ii) the constitution and governance of any religious or charitable foundation; or 
(iii) the meaning of words or terms used in particular districts or by particular classes of people, 
the opinions of persons having special means of knowledge thereon, are relevant facts. 
44. Opinion on relationship, when relevant.—When the Court has to form an opinion as to the 
relationship of one person to another, the opinion, expressed by conduct, as to the existence of such 
relationship, of any person who, as a member of the family or otherwise, has special means of knowledge 
on the subject, is a relevant fact: 
Provided that such opinion shall not be sufficient to prove a marriage in proceedings under the 
Divorce Act, 1869 (4 of 1869), or in prosecution under sections 82 and 84 of the Bharatiya Nyaya 
Sanhita, 2023. 
Illustrations. 
(a) The question is, whether A and B were married. The fact that they were usually received and 
treated by their friends as husband and wife, is relevant. 
(b) The question is, whether A was the legitimate son of B. The fact that A was always treated as 
such by members of the family, is relevant. 
45. Grounds of opinion, when relevant.—Whenever the opinion of any living person is relevant, 
the grounds on which such opinion is based are also relevant. 
Illustration. 
An expert may give an account of experiments performed by him for the purpose of forming his 
opinion. 
Character when relevant 
46. In civil cases character to prove conduct imputed, irrelevant.—In civil cases the fact that the 
character of any person concerned is such as to render probable or improbable any conduct imputed to 
him, is irrelevant, except in so far as such character appears from facts otherwise relevant. 
23 
47. In criminal cases previous good character relevant.—In criminal proceedings the fact that the 
person accused is of a good character, is relevant. 
48. Evidence of character or previous sexual experience not relevant in certain cases.—In a 
prosecution for an offence under section 64, section 65, section 66, section 67, section 68,                         
section 69, section 70, section 71, section 74, section 75, section 76, section 77 or section 78 of the 
Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 or for attempt to commit any such offence, where the question of consent 
is in issue, evidence of the character of the victim or of such person’s previous sexual experience with 
any person shall not be relevant on the issue of such consent or the quality of consent. 
49. Previous bad character not relevant, except in reply.—In criminal proceedings, the fact that 
the accused has a bad character, is irrelevant, unless evidence has been given that he has a good character, 
in which case it becomes relevant. 
Explanation 1.—This section does not apply to cases in which the bad character of any person is 
itself a fact in issue. 
Explanation 2.—A previous conviction is relevant as evidence of bad character. 
50. Character as affecting damages.—In civil cases, the fact that the character of any person is such 
as to affect the amount of damages which he ought to receive, is relevant. 
Explanation.—In this section and sections 46, 47 and 49, the word “character” includes both 
reputation and disposition; but, except as provided in section 49, evidence may be given only of general 
reputation and general disposition, and not of particular acts by which reputation or disposition has been 
shown. 
PART III 
ON PROOF 
CHAPTER III 
FACTS WHICH NEED NOT BE PROVED 
51. Fact judicially noticeable need not be proved.—No fact of which the Court will take judicial 
notice need be proved. 
52. Facts of which Court shall take judicial notice.—(1) The Court shall take judicial notice of the

other persons authorised by law to appear or act before it; 
(l) the rule of the road on land or at sea. 
(2) In the cases referred to in sub-section (1) and also on all matters of public history, literature, 
science or art, the Court may resort for its aid to appropriate books or documents of reference and if the 
Court is called upon by any person to take judicial notice of any fact, it may refuse to do so unless and 
until such person produces any such book or document as it may consider necessary to enable it to do so. 
53. Facts admitted need not be proved.—No fact needs to be proved in any proceeding which the 
parties thereto or their agents agree to admit at the hearing, or which, before the hearing, they agree to 
admit by any writing under their hands, or which by any rule of pleading in force at the time they are 
deemed to have admitted by their pleadings: 
Provided that the Court may, in its discretion, require the facts admitted to be proved otherwise than 
by such admissions. 
CHAPTER IV 
OF ORAL EVIDENCE 
54. Proof of facts by oral evidence.—All facts, except the contents of documents may be proved by 
oral evidence. 
55. Oral evidence to be direct.—Oral evidence shall, in all cases whatever, be direct; if it refers                 
to,— 
(i) a fact which could be seen, it must be the evidence of a witness who says he saw it; 
(ii) a fact which could be heard, it must be the evidence of a witness who says he heard it; 
(iii) a fact which could be perceived by any other sense or in any other manner, it must be the 
evidence of a witness who says he perceived it by that sense or in that manner; 
(iv) an opinion or to the grounds on which that opinion is held, it must be the evidence of the 
person who holds that opinion on those grounds: 
Provided that the opinions of experts expressed in any treatise commonly offered for sale, and the 
grounds on which such opinions are held, may be proved by the production of such treatises if the author 
is dead or cannot be found, or has become incapable of giving evidence, or cannot be called as a witness 
without an amount of delay or expense which the Court regards as unreasonable: 
Provided further that, if oral evidence refers to the existence or condition of any material thing other 
than a document, the Court may, if it thinks fit, require the production of such material thing for its 
inspection. 
CHAPTER V 
OF DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE 
56. Proof of contents of documents.—The contents of documents may be proved either by primary 
or by secondary evidence. 
57. Primary evidence.—Primary evidence means the document itself produced for the inspection of 
the Court. 
25 
Explanation 1.—Where a document is executed in several parts, each part is primary evidence of 
the document. 
Explanation 2.—Where a document is executed in counterpart, each counterpart being executed 
by one or some of the parties only, each counterpart is primary evidence as against the parties 
executing it. 
Explanation 3.—Where a number of documents are all made by one uniform process, as in the 
case of printing, lithography or photography, each is primary evidence of the contents of the rest; but, 
where they are all copies of a common original, they are not primary evidence of the contents of the 
original. 
Explanation 4.—Where an electronic or digital record is created or stored, and such storage 
occurs simultaneously or sequentially in multiple files, each such file is primary evidence. 
Explanation 5.—Where an electronic or digital record is produced from proper custody, such 
electronic and digital record is primary evidence unless it is disputed. 
Explanation 6.—Where a video recording is simultaneously stored in electronic form and 
transmitted or broadcast or transferred to another, each of the stored recordings is primary evidence. 
Explanation 7.—Where an electronic or digital record is stored in multiple storage spaces in a 
computer resource, each such automated storage, including temporary files, is primary evidence. 
Illustration. 
A person is shown to have been in possession of a number of placards, all printed at one time from 
one original. Any one of the placards is primary evidence of the contents of any other, but no one of them 
is primary evidence of the contents of the original. 
58. Secondary evidence.—Secondary evidence includes— 
(i) certified copies given under the provisions hereinafter contained; 
(ii) copies made from the original by mechanical processes which in themselves ensure the 
accuracy of the copy, and copies compared with such copies; 
(iii) copies made from or compared with the original; 
(iv) counterparts of documents as against the parties who did not execute them; 
(v) oral accounts of the contents of a document given by some person who has himself seen it; 
(vi) oral admissions; 
(vii) written admissions; 
(viii) evidence of a person who has examined a document, the original of which consists of 
numerous accounts or other documents which cannot conveniently be examined in Court, and who is 
skilled in the examination of such documents. 
Illustrations. 
(a) A photograph of an original is secondary evidence of its contents, though the two have not been 
compared, if it is proved that the thing photographed was the original. 
(b) A copy compared with a copy of a letter made by a copying machine is secondary evidence of the 
contents of the letter, if it is shown that the copy made by the copying machine was made from the 
original. 
(c) A copy transcribed from a copy, but afterwards compared with the original, is secondary 
evidence; but the copy not so compared is not secondary evidence of the original, although the copy from 
which it was transcribed was compared with the original. 
(d) Neither an oral account of a copy compared with the original, nor an oral account of a photograph 
or machine-copy of the original, is secondary evidence of the original. 
26 
59. Proof of documents by primary evidence.— Documents shall be proved by primary 
evidence except in the cases hereinafter mentioned. 
60. Cases in which secondary evidence relating to documents may be given.—Secondary 
evidence may be given of the existence, condition, or contents of a document in the following cases, 
namely:— 
(a) when the original is shown or appears to be in the possession or power— 
(i) of the person against whom the document is sought to be proved; or 
(ii) of any person out of reach of, or not subject to, the process of the Court; or 
(iii) of any person legally bound to produce it,  
and when, after the notice mentioned in section 64 such person does not produce it; 
(b) when the existence, condition or contents of the original have been proved to be admitted in 
writing by the person against whom it is proved or by his representative in interest; 
(c) when the original has been destroyed or lost, or when the party offering evidence of its 
contents cannot, for any other reason not arising from his own default or neglect, produce it in 
reasonable time; 
(d) when the original is of such a nature as not to be easily movable; 
(e) when the original is a public document within the meaning of section 74; 
(f) when the original is a document of which a certified copy is permitted by this Adhiniyam, or 
by any other law in force in India to be given in evidence; 
(g) when the originals consist of numerous accounts or other documents which cannot 
conveniently be examined in Court, and the fact to be proved is the general result of the whole 
collection. 
Explanation.—For the purposes of— 
(i) clauses (a), (c) and (d), any secondary evidence of the contents of the document is admissible; 
(ii) clause (b), the written admission is admissible; 
(iii) clause (e) or (f), a certified copy of the document, but no other kind of secondary evidence, is 
admissible; 
(iv) clause (g), evidence may be given as to the general result of the documents by any person 
who has examined them, and who is skilled in the examination of such document. 
61. Electronic or digital record.—Nothing in this Adhiniyam shall apply to deny the 
admissibility of an electronic or digital record in the evidence on the ground that it is an electronic or 
digital record and such record shall, subject to section 63, have the same legal effect, validity and 
enforceability as other document.
