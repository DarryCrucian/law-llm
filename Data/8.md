CHAPTER XVII
OF OFFENCES AGAINST PROPERTY
Of theft
303. Theft.—(1) Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession
of any person without that person’s consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to
commit theft.
Explanation 1.—A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the
subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed from the
earth.
Explanation 2.—A moving effected by the same act which affects the severance may be a theft.
Explanation 3.—A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which prevented
it from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it.
Explanation 4.—A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal,
and to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal.
Explanation 5.—The consent mentioned in this section may be express or implied, and may be given
either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either express or
implied.
Illustrations.
(a) A cuts down a tree on Z’s ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out of Z’s
possession without Z’s consent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has
committed theft.
(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z’s dog to follow it. Here, if A’s intention
be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z’s possession without Z’s consent. A has committed theft as soon
as Z’s dog has begun to follow A.
(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order
that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft
of the treasure.
(d) A being Z’s servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z’s plate, dishonestly runs away with the
plate, without Z’s consent. A has committed theft.
(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A
carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z’s possession. It could not therefore
be taken out of Z’s possession, and A has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal
breach of trust.
(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z’s
possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft.
(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits
no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property.
(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z’s house. Not venturing to misappropriate the
ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly
improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and
selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits theft.
(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweler, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the
jeweler any debt for which the jeweler might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop
openly, takes his watch by force out of Z’s hand, and carries it away. Here A, though he may have
committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, in as much as what he did was not done
dishonestly.
87
(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for
the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z’s possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as
a security for his debt, he commits theft, in as much as he takes it dishonestly.
(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z’s possession without Z’s consent, not
having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property in as
much as he takes it dishonestly.
(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z’s possession without Z’s consent, with the intention of
keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has
therefore committed theft.
(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z’s library in Z’s absence, and takes away a book
without Z’s express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it.
Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z’s implied consent to use Z’s book. If this
was A’s impression, A has not committed theft.
(n) A asks charity from Z’s wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to
Z her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z’s wife is authorised to give away alms. If
this was A’s impression, A has not committed theft.
(o) A is the paramour of Z’s wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her
husband Z, and to be such property as she has no authority from Z to give. If A takes the property
dishonestly, he commits theft.
(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A’s own property, takes that property out
of Z’s possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft.
(2) Whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term
which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both and in case of second or subsequent
conviction of any person under this section, he shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term
which shall not be less than one year but which may extend to five years and with fine:
Provided that in cases of theft where the value of the stolen property is less than five thousand rupees,
and a person is convicted for the first time, shall upon return of the value of property or restoration of the
stolen property, shall be punished with community service.
304. Snatching.—(1) Theft is snatching if, in order to commit theft, the offender suddenly or quickly
or forcibly seizes or secures or grabs or takes away from any person or from his possession any movable
property.
(2) Whoever commits snatching, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term
which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to fine.
305. Theft in a dwelling house, or means of transportation or place of worship, etc.—Whoever
commits theft—
(a) in any building, tent or vessel used as a human dwelling or used for the custody of property;
or
(b) of any means of transport used for the transport of goods or passengers; or
(c) of any article or goods from any means of transport used for the transport of goods or
passengers; or
(d) of idol or icon in any place of worship; or
(e) of any property of the Government or of a local authority,
shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years,
and shall also be liable to fine.
306. Theft by clerk or servant of property in possession of master.—Whoever, being a clerk or
servant, or being employed in the capacity of a clerk or servant, commits theft in respect of any property
88
in the possession of his master or employer, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for
a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.
307. Theft after preparation made for causing death, hurt or restraint in order to committing
of theft.—Whoever commits theft, having made preparation for causing death, or hurt, or restraint, or
fear of death, or of hurt, or of restraint, to any person, in order to the committing of such theft, or in order
to the effecting of his escape after the committing of such theft, or in order to the retaining of property
taken by such theft, shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten
years, and shall also be liable to fine.
Illustrations.
(a) A commits theft on property in Z’s possession; and while committing this theft, he has a loaded
pistol under his garment, having provided this pistol for the purpose of hurting Z in case Z should resist.
A has committed the offence defined in this section.
(b) A picks Z’s pocket, having posted several of his companions near him, in order that they may
restrain Z, if Z should perceive what is passing and should resist, or should attempt to apprehend A. A
has committed the offence defined in this section.
Of extortion
308. Extortion.—(1) Whoever intentionally puts any person in fear of any injury to that person, or to
any other, and thereby dishonestly induces the person so put in fear to deliver to any person any property,
or valuable security or anything signed or sealed which may be converted into a valuable security,
commits extortion.
Illustrations.
(a) A threatens to publish a defamatory libel concerning Z unless Z gives him money. He thus
induces Z to give him money. A has committed extortion.
(b) A threatens Z that he will keep Z’s child in wrongful confinement, unless Z will sign and deliver
to A a promissory note binding Z to pay certain monies to A. Z signs and delivers the note. A has
committed extortion.
(c) A threatens to send club-men to plough up Z’s field unless Z will sign and deliver to B a bond
binding Z under a penalty to deliver certain produce to B, and thereby induces Z to sign and deliver the
bond. A has committed extortion.
(d) A, by putting Z in fear of grievous hurt, dishonestly induces Z to sign or affix his seal to a blank
paper and deliver it to A. Z signs and delivers the paper to A. Here, as the paper so signed may be
converted into a valuable security. A has committed extortion.
(e) A threatens Z by sending a message through an electronic device that “Your child is in my
possession, and will be put to death unless you send me one lakh rupees.” A thus induces Z to give him
money. A has committed extortion.
(2) Whoever commits extortion shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term
which may extend to seven years, or with fine, or with both.
(3) Whoever, in order to the committing of extortion, puts any person in fear, or attempts to put any

89
(6) Whoever, in order to the committing of extortion, puts or attempts to put any person in fear of an
accusation, against that person or any other, of having committed, or attempted to commit, an offence
punishable with death or with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend

ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.
(7) Whoever commits extortion by putting any person in fear of an accusation against that person or

attempted to induce any other person to commit such offence, shall be punished with imprisonment of
either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.
Of robbery and dacoity
309. Robbery.—(1) In all robbery there is either theft or extortion.
(2) Theft is robbery if, in order to the committing of the theft, or in committing the theft, or in
carrying away or attempting to carry away property obtained by the theft, the offender, for that end
voluntarily causes or attempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint, or fear of instant
death or of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint.

the person put in fear, and commits the extortion by putting that person in fear of instant death, of instant
hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint to that person or to some other person, and, by so putting in fear,
induces the person so put in fear then and there to deliver up the thing extorted.
Explanation.—The offender is said to be present if he is sufficiently near to put the other person in
fear of instant death, of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint.
Illustrations.
(a) A holds Z down, and fraudulently takes Z’s money and jewels from Z’s clothes, without Z’s
consent. Here A has committed theft, and, in order to the committing of that theft, has voluntarily caused
wrongful restraint to Z. A has therefore committed robbery.
(b) A meets Z on the high road, shows a pistol, and demands Z’s purse. Z, in consequence, surrenders
his purse. Here A has extorted the purse from Z by putting him in fear of instant hurt, and being at the
time of committing the extortion in his presence. A has therefore committed robbery.
(c) A meets Z and Z’s child on the high road. A takes the child, and threatens to fling it down a
precipice, unless Z delivers his purse. Z, in consequence, delivers his purse. Here A has extorted the
purse from Z, by causing Z to be in fear of instant hurt to the child who is there present. A has therefore
committed robbery on Z.
(d) A obtains property from Z by saying—“Your child is in the hands of my gang, and will be put to
death unless you send us ten thousand rupees”. This is extortion, and punishable as such; but it is not
robbery, unless Z is put in fear of the instant death of his child.

Illustrations.
(a) A takes property belonging to Z out of Z’s possession, in good faith believing at the time when he
takes it, that the property belongs to himself. A is not guilty of theft; but if A, after discovering his
mistake, dishonestly appropriates the property to his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this
section.
(b) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z’s library in Z’s absence, and takes away a book
without Z’s express consent. Here, if A was under the impression that he had Z’s implied consent to take
the book for the purpose of reading it, A has not committed theft. But, if A afterwards sells the book for
his own benefit, he is guilty of an offence under this section.
(c) A and B, being, joint owners of a horse. A takes the horse out of B’s possession, intending to use
it. Here, as A has a right to use the horse, he does not dishonestly misappropriate it. But, if A sells the
horse and appropriates the whole proceeds to his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section.
Explanation 1.—A dishonest misappropriation for a time only is a misappropriation within the
meaning of this section.
91
Illustration.
A finds a Government promissory note belonging to Z, bearing a blank endorsement. A, knowing that
the note belongs to Z, pledges it with a banker as a security for a loan, intending at a future time to restore
it to Z. A has committed an offence under this section.
Explanation 2.—A person who finds property not in the possession of any other person, and takes
such property for the purpose of protecting it for, or of restoring it to, the owner, does not take or
misappropriate it dishonestly, and is not guilty of an offence; but he is guilty of the offence above
defined, if he appropriates it to his own use, when he knows or has the means of discovering the owner,
or before he has used reasonable means to discover and give notice to the owner and has kept the
property a reasonable time to enable the owner to claim it.
What are reasonable means or what is a reasonable time in such a case, is a question of fact.
It is not necessary that the finder should know who is the owner of the property, or that any particular
person is the owner of it; it is sufficient if, at the time of appropriating it, he does not believe it to be his
own property, or in good faith believe that the real owner cannot be found.
Illustrations.
(a) A finds a rupee on the high road, not knowing to whom the rupee belongs, A picks up the rupee.

cheque. But the name of the person, who has drawn the cheque, appears. A knows that this person can
direct him to the person in whose favour the cheque was drawn. A appropriates the cheque without
attempting to discover the owner. He is guilty of an offence under this section.
(d) A sees Z drop his purse with money in it. A picks up the purse with the intention of restoring it
to Z, but afterwards appropriates it to his own use. A has committed an offence under this section.
(e) A finds a purse with money, not knowing to whom it belongs; he afterwards discovers that it
belongs to Z, and appropriates it to his own use. A is guilty of an offence under this section.
(f) A finds a valuable ring, not knowing to whom it belongs. A sells it immediately without
attempting to discover the owner. A is guilty of an offence under this section.
315. Dishonest misappropriation of property possessed by deceased person at the time of his
death.—Whoever dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use any property, knowing that
such property was in the possession of a deceased person at the time of that person’s decease, and has not
since been in the possession of any person legally entitled to such possession, shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to
fine, and if the offender at the time of such person’s decease was employed by him as a clerk or servant,
the imprisonment may extend to seven years.
Illustration.
Z dies in possession of furniture and money. His servant A, before the money comes into the
possession of any person entitled to such possession, dishonestly misappropriates it. A has committed the
offence defined in this section.
316. Criminal breach of trust.—(1) Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with
any dominion over property, dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use that property, or
dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in
which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal contract, express or implied, which he has made
touching the discharge of such trust, or wilfully suffers any other person so to do, commits criminal
breach of trust.

Provident Fund or Family Pension Fund established by any law for the time being in force, shall be
deemed to have been entrusted with the amount of the contribution so deducted by him and if he makes

civil action for breach of contract.
(h) A intentionally deceives Z into a belief that A has performed A’s part of a contract made with Z,
which he has not performed, and thereby dishonestly induces Z to pay money. A cheats.

CHAPTER XVIII
OF OFFENCES RELATING TO DOCUMENTS AND TO PROPERTY MARKS
335. Making a false document.—A person is said to make a false document or false electronic
record—
(A) Who dishonestly or fraudulently—
(i) makes, signs, seals or executes a document or part of a document;
(ii) makes or transmits any electronic record or part of any electronic record;
(iii) affixes any electronic signature on any electronic record;
(iv) makes any mark denoting the execution of a document or the authenticity of the
electronic signature,
with the intention of causing it to be believed that such document or part of document, electronic
record or electronic signature was made, signed, sealed, executed, transmitted or affixed by or by the
authority of a person by whom or by whose authority he knows that it was not made, signed, sealed,
executed or affixed; or
(B) Who without lawful authority, dishonestly or fraudulently, by cancellation or otherwise,
alters a document or an electronic record in any material part thereof, after it has been made, executed
or affixed with electronic signature either by himself or by any other person, whether such person be
living or dead at the time of such alteration; or
(C) Who dishonestly or fraudulently causes any person to sign, seal, execute or alter a document
or an electronic record or to affix his electronic signature on any electronic record knowing that such
person by reason of unsoundness of mind or intoxication cannot, or that by reason of deception
100
practised upon him, he does not know the contents of the document or electronic record or the nature
of the alteration.
Illustrations.
(a) A has a letter of credit upon B for rupees 10,000, written by Z. A, in order to defraud B, adds
cipher to the 10,000, and makes the sum 1,00,000 intending that it may be believed by B that Z so wrote
the letter. A has committed forgery.
(b) A, without Z’s authority, affixes Z’s seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance of an
estate from Z to A, with the intention of selling the estate to B and thereby of obtaining from B the
purchase-money. A has committed forgery.
(c) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any sum having been
inserted in the cheque. A fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand rupees. A
commits forgery.
(d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without inserting the sum payable
and authorises B to fill up the cheque by inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the
purpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of
twenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery.
(e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B’s authority, intending to
discount it as a genuine bill with a banker and intending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A
draws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the security of B,
and thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery.
(f) Z’s will contains these words—“I direct that all my remaining property be equally divided
between A, B and C.” A dishonestly scratches out B’s name, intending that it may be believed that the
whole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery.
(g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his order by writing on
the bill the words “Pay to Z or his order” and signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words
“Pay to Z or his order”, and thereby converts the special endorsement into a blank endorsement. B
commits forgery.
(h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate, executes a
conveyance of the same estate to B, dated six months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z,
intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to Z. A has
committed forgery.
(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee from the legatee named
by Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will according to his instructions, induces Z to
sign the will. A has committed forgery.
(j) A writes a letter and signs it with B’s name without B’s authority, certifying that A is a man of
good character and in distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such
letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as A made a false document in order to induce Z to
part with property, A has committed forgery.
(k) A without B’s authority writes a letter and signs it in B’s name certifying to A’s character,
intending thereby to obtain employment under Z. A has committed forgery in as much as he intended to
deceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter into an express or implied contract
for service.
Explanation 1.—A man’s signature of his own name may amount to forgery.
Illustrations.
(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was
drawn by another person of the same name. A has committed forgery.
101
(b) A writes the word “accepted” on a piece of paper and signs it with Z’s name, in order that B may
afterwards write on the paper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bill as though it
had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper
pursuant to A’s intention, B is also guilty of forgery.
(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A
endorses the bill in his own name, intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person
to whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery.
(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B, after the seizure of the estate,
in collusion with Z, executes a lease of the estate, to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and dates
the lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the
lease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery
by antedating it.
(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A’s benefit, and with intent to
defraud his creditors; and in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note binding
himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the note, intending that it may be believed to
have been made before A was on the point of insolvency. A has committed forgery under the first head of
the definition.
Explanation 2.—The making of a false document in the name of a fictitious person, intending it to be
believed that the document was made by a real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it
to be believed that the document was made by the person in his lifetime, may amount to forgery.
Illustration.
A draws a bill of exchange upon a fictitious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill in the name of
such fictitious person with intent to negotiate it. A commits forgery.
Explanation 3.—For the purposes of this section, the expression “affixing electronic signature” shall
have the meaning assigned to it in clause (d) of sub-section (1) of section 2 of the Information

document or electronic record, with intent to cause damage or injury, to the public or to any person, or to
support any claim or title, or to cause any person to part with property, or to enter into any express or
implied contract, or with intent to commit fraud or that fraud may be committed, commits forgery.
(2) Whoever commits forgery shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term
which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.

imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to
fine.
337. Forgery of record of Court or of public register, etc.—Whoever forges a document or an
electronic record, purporting to be a record or proceeding of or in a Court or an identity document issued
by Government including voter identity card or Aadhaar Card, or a register of birth, marriage or burial, or
a register kept by a public servant as such, or a certificate or document purporting to be made by a public

therein, or to confess judgment, or a power of attorney, shall be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.
Explanation.—For the purposes of this section, “register” includes any list, data or record of any
entries maintained in the electronic form as defined in clause (r) of sub-section (1) of section 2 of the
Information Technology Act, 2000 (21 of 2000).
102
338. Forgery of valuable security, will, etc.—Whoever forges a document which purports to be a
valuable security or a will, or an authority to adopt a son, or which purports to give authority to any
person to make or transfer any valuable security, or to receive the principal, interest or dividends thereon,

337 of this Sanhita, be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to
seven years, and shall also be liable to fine; and if the document is one of the description mentioned in
section 338, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description, for
a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.
