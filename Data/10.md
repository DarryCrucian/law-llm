 269. (1) If, when such evidence has been taken, or at any previous stage of the case,

 police officer or to a Magistrate, one or more persons is or are accused before a Magistrate
 of any offence triable by a Magistrate, and the Magistrate by whom the case is heard
 discharges or acquits all or any of the accused, and is of opinion that there was no reasonable
 ground for making the accusation against them or any of them, the Magistrate may, by his
 order of discharge or acquittal, if the person upon whose complaint or information the
 accusation was made is present, call upon him forthwith to show cause why he should not

 case which is subject to appeal under sub-section (6), the compensation shall not be paid to
 him before the period allowed for the presentation of the appeal has elapsed, or, if an appeal
 is presented, before the appeal has been decided; and where such order is made in a case
 which is not so subject to appeal the compensation shall not be paid before the expiration
 of one month from the date of the order.
 (8) The provisions of this section apply to summons-cases as well as to

 desires to plead guilty to the charge without appearing before the Magistrate, he shall
 transmit to the Magistrate, by post or by messenger, a letter containing his plea and also the
 amount of fine specified in the summons.
 (2) The Magistrate may, in his discretion, convict the accused in his absence, on his
 plea of guilty and sentence him to pay the fine specified in the summons, and the amount
 transmitted by the accused shall be adjusted towards that fine, or where a pleader authorised
 by the accused in this behalf pleads guilty on behalf of the accused, the Magistrate shall
 record the plea as nearly as possible in the words used by the pleader and may, in his
 discretion, convict the accused on such plea and sentence him as aforesaid.
 277. (1) If the Magistrate does not convict the accused under section 275 or
 section 276, the Magistrate shall proceed to hear the prosecution and take all such evidence
 as may be produced in support of the prosecution, and also to hear the accused and take all

 accused, issue a summons to any witness directing him to attend or to produce any document
 or other thing.
 (3) The Magistrate may, before summoning any witness on such application, require

 offence triable under this Chapter, which from the facts admitted or proved he appears to
 have committed, whatever may be the nature of the complaint or summons, if the Magistrate
 is satisfied that the accused would not be prejudiced thereby.
 279. (1) If the summons has been issued on complaint, and on the day appointed for
 the appearance of the accused, or any day subsequent thereto to which the hearing may be
 adjourned, the complainant does not appear, the Magistrate shall, notwithstanding anything
 hereinbefore contained, acquit the accused, unless for some reason he thinks it proper to
 adjourn the hearing of the case to some other day:
 Provided that where the complainant is represented by a pleader or by the officer
 conducting the prosecution or where the Magistrate is of opinion that the personal
 attendance of the complainant is not necessary, the Magistrate may, dispense with his
 attendance and proceed with the case.
 (2) The provisions of sub-section (1) shall, so far as may be, apply also to cases
 where the non-appearance of the complainant is due to his death.
 280. If a complainant, at any time before a final order is passed in any case under this
 Chapter, satisfies the Magistrate that there are sufficient grounds for permitting him to

 Judicial Magistrate, may, for reasons to be recorded by him, stop the proceedings at any
 stage without pronouncing any judgment and where such stoppage of proceedings is made
 after the evidence of the principal witnesses has been recorded, pronounce a judgment of
 acquittal, and in any other case, release the accused, and such release shall have the effect
 of discharge.
 282. When in the course of the trial of a summons-case relating to an offence punishable
 with imprisonment for a term exceeding six months, it appears to the Magistrate that in the
 interests of justice, the offence should be tried in accordance with the procedure for the trial
 of warrant-cases, such Magistrate may proceed to re-hear the case in the manner provided
 by this Sanhita for the trial of warrant-cases and may re-call any witness who may have
 been examined.

 attendance is dispensed with, in the presence of his pleader:
 Provided that where the evidence of a woman below the age of eighteen years who is
 alleged to have been subjected to rape or any other sexual offence, is to be recorded, the

 proceeding under Chapter IX has been commenced under this Sanhita.

 by him in this behalf:
 Provided that evidence of a witness under this sub-section may also be recorded by
 audio-video electronic means in the presence of the advocate of the person accused of the

 certificate that the evidence could not be taken down by himself for the reasons referred to
 in sub-section (1).

 Magistrate may, in his discretion take down, or cause to be taken down, any part of such
 evidence in the form of question and answer.

 of the record.

 down in that language;
 (b) if he gives evidence in any other language, it may, if practicable, be taken
 down in that language, and if it is not practicable to do so, a true translation of the
 evidence in the language of the Court shall be prepared as the examination of the
 witness proceeds, signed by the Magistrate or presiding Judge, and shall form part of
 the record;
 (c) where under clause (b) evidence is taken down in a language other than the
 language of the Court, a true translation thereof in the language of the Court shall be
 prepared as soon as practicable, signed by the Magistrate or presiding Judge, and
 shall form part of the record:
 Provided that when under clause (b) evidence is taken down in English and a
 translation thereof in the language of the Court is not required by any of the parties,
 the Court may dispense with such translation.
 313. (1) As the evidence of each witness taken under section 310 or section 311 is
